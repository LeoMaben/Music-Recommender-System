# Music-Recommender-System
## Motivation
Goal of this project is to use the different ML Concepts that I've learned over the years through work and studies in a real world application while simulatenously helping me refine these topics by getting an understanding with everyday challenges one can solve.
## The Problem
The project revovles around the use of the Spotify Million Playlist and developing a recommending system that can suggest accurate songs learning from information on the millions of playlist entries each containing multiple 100s of songs
## TODO: 
1. Setup Repo
2. Download the raw Datasets
3. Data Preprocessing
4. EDA to get an idea of the pattern, distribution and overall analysis of the data
5. Feature Engineering
6. Build Recommendation Models (LSTM/Transformers as possible solution?)
7. Evaluate Model
8. Model Tuning and Optimization
